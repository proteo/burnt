      <h3>About</h3>
      Burnt is a dark theme for JetBrains IDEs (2019.1+) with the right visual clues to assist you in your long coding journeys. The accompanying color scheme features a rich, vibrant palette, carefully tuned to help you stay focused and productive.
      <br/><br/>
      <h3>Why the Burnt theme?</h3>
      Because other dark themes are not dark or good enouhg for my taste. This is a really dark theme, crafted with great attention to the detail, and trying to cover the whole IDE to provide a comprehensive coding experience. It's main purpose is to let you focus on what matters: the code.
      <br/><br/>
      Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
